# Puppy-Patter
Milestone Game Project 1!

Hello, everyone!

Welcome to my first project! I hope you all enoy it!

I left room for adding onto the game in the future.

Object of the game:

It is simple. All you need to do is pat the good boy! (click on the derpy lab!)
Each time you pat the good boy, your number of pats increases. Pats act as the games currency for purchasing other dogs that act as score modifiers and idle patting. The goal is to purchase the 4th Dimensional Doggo for 100 million pats to win the game.
The start over button clears your progress, as well as completing the game. 

**Please note I have not implemented a 'save game' feature yet so each time you navigate away from the page it will reset.
